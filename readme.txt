Study/Project design:
  The game works on pygame which is a python library to make games an we use random module for the logic,
  first we load all the images, create the variables, and put all the words that should be guessed and create a window to play the game in
  then we create all the functions i.e. 
    draw(): this function is used to draw all the ui and graphics on the window
    reset_game(): this fuction resets all the game variables so that we can play the new game
    cutsceen(): this function displays the cutsceen 
    main(): this function is responsib;e for the main logic of the hangman game and taking the user input
    main_menu(): this function is used to create the main menu for the game
  after this we use a while loop to play a new game

Hardware Specification:
  Minimum system requirements
    OS: 64-bit Windows 7 or later or OS X 10.11 or later.
    Processor: 1.5GHz or faster.
    Memory: 4GB (4,096MB) RAM.
    Free HDD space: 3GB.
    Hardware: keyboard, mouse, and headset with microphone.

Outcome Measures:
  we will get a pop up window with the game on it.

Data Collection and Analysis:
  N.A.

Drawbacks and Limitaion:
  the game is only available for desktop and may not work on MAC OS (due to pygame not supporting it)
  the game could be more user friendly and have better UI

Conclusion:
    In conclution the projects is a simple yet fun game of hangman which is made possible by the art and music which the whole team worked hard to pull of.
    Future work on the project would be to make it more accessible by making it compatible with other devices such as smartphones
